## Course Overview
This course introduces the fundamental principles and practical applications of machine learning.
You will learn how computers find patterns in data, make predictions, and evaluate performance.
The course emphasizes both theory and hands-on implementation with modern ML tools.

## Catalog Description (Short)
Supervised learning (classification/regression), unsupervised learning (clustering/
dimensionality reduction), model evaluation, and advanced topics like ensemble methods
and deep learning, with practical implementation using current ML frameworks.

## Program Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, you should be able to:
- Explain key ML foundations (probability and related techniques)
- Implement supervised algorithms (linear/logistic regression, decision trees)
- Use unsupervised methods (k-means, PCA)
- Apply ensemble methods (random forests, boosting)
- Evaluate models (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Understand MLPs and deep learning basics
- Handle overfitting with regularization and cross-validation
- Build end-to-end ML pipelines for real problems
- Use modern libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Analyze ML research and ethical considerations

## How to Succeed (Practical Guide)
- Attend class and take concise notes after each session
- Keep a running glossary (terms, metrics, algorithms)
- For each topic, do three things: concept summary, small code demo, reflection
- Rebuild algorithms from scratch on small datasets before using libraries
- Evaluate every model with proper metrics and a clear baseline

## Weekly Study Routine (Suggested)
- Before class: 30-45 min skim of ZyBook section and key terms
- After class: 60-90 min recap + one short notebook experiment
- Weekend: 2-3 hours on assignment/project work and review

## Project Strategy
- Pick a real dataset early and define a simple baseline model
- Track progress: data prep -> baseline -> feature work -> model tuning -> evaluation
- Keep code clean and documented; make results reproducible

## Ethical Awareness
- Always consider bias, fairness, data privacy, and model transparency
- Document limitations and potential risks in your reports

## Questions to Ask Yourself Each Week
- Can I explain the core idea in 2-3 sentences?
- Do I know when to use this method and why?
- Can I implement it and evaluate it correctly?
- What are common failure modes or pitfalls?
